## Getting Started

In this branch, there is a machine learning model named Smishing_Model which can be used in detecting Smishing in messages.
Here, the Feature Extraction technique is BOW. Which is the bow_data_extraction.pickle
The development of this model can be seen in Learning_model_creation.ipynb which can be opened with Jupiter notebook.

## Contributing

If you have any feedback or criticism regarding the code. You are able to contact me directly and I am more than happy to receive it.

## Acknowledgments

Here are the database that I used in developing the model.
